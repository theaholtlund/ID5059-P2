# Detecting Fraudulent Card Transactions

### Overview:

This project aims to develop and evaluate supervised learning classifier models to predict genuine and fraudulent credit card transactions using synthetically generated attribute data. The models' performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score will be assessed, along with their final Kaggle score.

### Running the program:

1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with necessary libraries like Scikit-Learn, Pandas and NumPy.
2. **Download the Notebook**: Clone or download the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) from the repository.
3. **Data Files**: Please note that the data files have not been uploaded to the repository due to their size. The data sets therefore have to be acquire separately.
4. **Run the Notebook**: Open the Jupyter Notebook in JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
5. **Execute Cells**: Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to load the data, preprocess it, train the models and evaluate their performance.
6. **Review Results**: Examine the results from running the notebook, including model performance metrics and Kaggle scores.
